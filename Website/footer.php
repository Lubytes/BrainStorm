      <h3>Our Goal</h3>
	  <hr>
      <p>We want to share knowledge.</p>
      <p>We do not believe in the saying "knowledge wants to be free" because certain
	  things should always be kept private. We do however believe that if someone wants
	  to share an idea, they should be able to do so. BrainStorm's goal is to allow users to
	  communicate with each other. Share ideas. Expand upon the ideas of others. It all starts with you.</p>

      <h3>Our Organization</h3>
	  <hr>
      <p>We're definitely people oriented.</p>
      <p>You say jump and we'll answer 'how high'? BrainStorm is a company
	  that works for the people. The entire purpose of our company is to bring people together
	  and ensure an environment that works for everyone. Within our own ranks we strive for equality,
	  diversity, and self actualization.</p>

      <h3>Your Involvement</h3> 
	  <hr>
      <p>You're just as important as we are.</p>
      <p>To be part of BrainStorm is to be part of a larger system. You will find yourself emersed in
	  an environment where people expect feedback. Your voice and opinions are wanted in all the fields you
	  know and love! If you want to add some terms to the conversation, add some. If you want to link this to
	  another idea, do it. BrainStorm is a growing environment and you can be the newest addition.</p>
